                                Jennifer’s inspirational story began in a small African village where she was born in Zimbabwe. Jennifer was born right at the beginning of the War of Liberation which saw her country go into turmoil where in an ideal world children play and have a carefree existence, Jennifer did not have any of that luxury as issues of survival meant she grew up quite quickly. However, her limited resources and literally living a life of fear from armed forces fighting each other over the country did not stop Jennifer from dreaming. <br>
                                <br>
                                Jennifer being one to burn the midnight candle regardless of the circumstances has studied and worked extensively with young people. She began her career as a special needs teacher and later moved to the United Kingdom where she went into fostering and adopting children who were affected by trauma caused in their early years caused by severe neglect, physical and emotional abuse. <br>
                                <br>
                                Jennifer has single handed nursed and raised over 20 children and helped them have a better and different narrative to life. All this Jennifer has achieved in the face of segregation and racial abuse herself which has not stopped her from doing what she does best – “building back young broken lives”. <br>
                                <br>
                                Jennifer has written her first book - Sailing Through the Storms of Life - which chronicles her life struggles. Jennifer has a degree in Psychology and Counselling. She also has extensive training in parenting children who have attachment issues and exhibit different behavioural issues. Her excellency in this work saw her being honoured by her Royal Majesty the Queen with an MBE. <br>
                                <br>
                                Jennifer has also spoken alongside big names such as Les Brown, Jack Cranfield, Marisa Peer, Getrude Matshe, James Dentley, Raul Lopez Jr, Renee Piane and Lindsey Wilson.
